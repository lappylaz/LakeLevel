## Purpose

LakeLevel is an iOS app that provides real-time water level monitoring for US lakes and reservoirs using USGS Water Services data.

## Problem Statement

Lake visitors, boaters, fishermen, and property owners need quick access to current lake water levels to plan activities. Existing options require navigating complex government websites or lack mobile-friendly interfaces.

- Shows historical trends (7-day, 30-day, 1-year)
- Allows users to favorite frequently-checked lakes
- Links directly to official USGS data sources

## Target Users

1. **Lake Property Owners** - Monitor water levels affecting their docks/property
2. **Boaters** - Check levels before launching
3. **Fishermen** - Track level changes that affect fishing
4. **Water Resource Managers** - Quick mobile reference

## Success Metrics

- App Store rating 4.5+
- User retention (weekly active users)
- Catalog expansion to 100+ lakes

## Non-Goals

- Real-time alerts/notifications (future consideration)
- Weather integration

- Android version (currently iOS only)

## Boundaries
